# Survive in Neon Lights

Survive in Neon Lights is a tower defense game created in unity by a couple of polish high school students, trying to not fail that hard for a second time in the *Ludum Dare* game jam. The team consisted of 2 person art department, a seasoned starcraft player and some full-time spaghetti plant workers.

They managed to make something in 72 hours, something they called *v1.0*.

### How to play:

So, you might have opened the game and have no god damn idea what to do. Naturally, you clicked "Controls" button like a weakling you are. I'm giving you the *last chance* to get the rest of your dignity and to go play the game like a **man**... You still there? Well, it's OK now, because I'm here. The whole thing is to build and defend your base from enemies. Simple stuff right? Let's start with the buildings available to you.

You got your generator *(I GOOOOT THE POOOWER)*. It's the heart of your base that generates electric impulses that move it all to life. An impulse will spread out and power all of your buildings, making them do their designed function and generally your base will appear to be more ***fancy*** than it actually is.

Mine *$Money Maker$* with each impulse will generate a small amount of currency. You need currency to set up new buildings. Cost of 'Mine' will increase depending on the amount of Mines you already posses. You can upgrade it to get more money per impulse.

**Turret** is a basic defensive structure, that shoots lasers. With each upgrade, turret's damage and range is increased, making it more deadly.

**Wall** is like, I uhhh... what else you want me to explain? IT'S A FUCKING WALL. Isn't it? Ok, it regenerates some of its hitpoints with each impulse. Walls' HP and HP-reg is increased with each upgrade.

There is also a limit to the amount of buildings you can set up. Sucks major ass, so we are giving you **Supply Depo** to increase number of structures you can have, so that's nice.

And your enemies: energy thirsty spiders that want to get to your generator. **KILL THEM WITH CRUELTY.** If not, you will die and dying isn't exactly fun or interactive gameplay.

That's basically it. Go and play the game now.

## How to build it yourself (why?)

1. Clone the repository.
   1. The branch master ***should be working***.
2. Add it as a project in Unity Hub.
   1. Add the "ld45" folder as the project folder.
   2. Use unity version "2019.2.8f1".

The game may not build for certain platforms due to duplicated "Transform" components in prefabs.
